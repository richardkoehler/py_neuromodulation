# py_neuromodulation - Paper motor intention fork
This is a fork of the package [py_neuromodulation](https://github.com/neuromodulation/py_neuromodulation).  
The code has been reduced to a minimal stripped-down version to reduce package size and number of dependencies.  

See the [py_neuromodulation preprint](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3212709/v1) for further information about the toolbox's rationale.
